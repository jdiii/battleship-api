1. Clone this repo to your computer with `git clone https://github.com/jdiii/battleship-api.git`
2. `cd` to the newly created directory and run the app with the devserver using the command `dev_appserver.py app.yaml`. Ensure it's

## Game Description:
Battleship is a two-player game where each player tries to shoot and sink all her opponent's ships.

## How to play:
1. Set up two users using the `/user` endpoint
2. In the setup phase of the game, each player sends requests to the `/game/{urlsafe_game_key}/position` endpoint to place all 5 ships in his fleet (Destroyer, Cruiser, Submarine, Battleship, and Aircraft Carrier) on his 10x10 board.
3. Once all the ships are placed on the board, the game starts. Players take turns shooting at the other player's ships using the `/game/{urlsafe_game_key}/move` endpoint.
4. The first player who sinks all of her opponent's ships wins.
